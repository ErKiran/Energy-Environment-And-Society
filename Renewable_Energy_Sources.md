# Solar Energy
### Solar Radiation
Solar irradiance (SI) is the power per unit area received from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range of the measuring instrument. The solar irradiance integrated over time is called solar irradiation, insolation, or solar exposure. However, insolation is often used interchangeably with irradiance in practice.

Irradiance may be measured in space or at the Earth's surface after atmospheric absorption and scattering. Irradiance in space is a function of distance from the Sun, the solar cycle, and cross-cycle changes. Irradiance on the Earth's surface additionally depends on the tilt of the measuring surface, the height of the sun above the horizon, and atmospheric conditions. Solar irradiance affects plant metabolism and animal behavior.

The study and measurement of solar irradiance have several important applications, including the prediction of energy generation from solar power plants, the heating and cooling loads of buildings, and in climate modeling and weather forecasting.

There are several measured types of solar irradiance.

* **Total Solar Irradiance (TSI)** is a measure of the solar power over all wavelengths per unit area incident on the Earth's upper atmosphere. It is measured perpendicular to the incoming sunlight. The solar constant is a conventional measure of mean TSI at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU).

* **Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)**, or beam radiation, is measured at the surface of the Earth at a given location with a surface element perpendicular to the Sun. It excludes diffuse solar radiation (radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components). Direct irradiance is equal to the extraterrestrial irradiance above the atmosphere minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering. Losses depend on time of day (length of light's path through the atmosphere depending on the solar elevation angle), cloud cover, moisture content and other contents. The irradiance above the atmosphere also varies with time of year (because the distance to the sun varies), although this effect is generally less significant compared to the effect of losses on DNI.
* **Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)**, or Diffuse Sky Radiation is the radiation at the Earth's surface from light scattered by the atmosphere. It is measured on a horizontal surface with radiation coming from all points in the sky excluding circumsolar radiation (radiation coming from the sun disk). There would be almost no DHI in the absence of atmosphere.
* **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)** is the total irradiance from the sun on a horizontal surface on Earth. It is the sum of direct irradiance (after accounting for the solar zenith angle of the sun z) and diffuse horizontal irradiance:
 **GHI = DHI+DNI × cos(z)**

The SI unit of irradiance is watt per square metre (W/m2).

### Irradiance in the Earth Surface

Average annual solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is roughly 1361 W/m2. The Sun's rays are attenuated as they pass through the atmosphere, leaving maximum normal surface irradiance at approximately 1000 W /m2 at sea level on a clear day. When 1361 W/m2 is arriving above the atmosphere (when the sun is at the zenith in a cloudless sky), direct sun is about 1050 W/m2, and global radiation on a horizontal surface at ground level is about 1120 W/m2. The latter figure includes radiation scattered or reemitted by atmosphere and surroundings. The actual figure varies with the Sun's angle and atmospheric circumstances. Ignoring clouds, the daily average insolation for the Earth is approximately 6 kWh/m2 = 21.6 MJ/m2.

The output of, for example, a photovoltaic panel, partly depends on the angle of the sun relative to the panel. One Sun is a unit of power flux, not a standard value for actual insolation. Sometimes this unit is referred to as a Sol, not to be confused with a sol, meaning one solar day.

### Solar Thermal Energy
Solar thermal energy (STE) is a form of energy and a technology for harnessing solar energy to generate thermal energy or electrical energy for use in industry, and in the residential and commercial sectors.

Solar thermal technologies capture the heat energy from the sun and use it for heating and/or the production of electricity. This is different from photovoltaic solar panels, which directly convert the sun’s radiation to electricity.

There are two main types of solar thermal systems for energy production – active and passive.  
* Active systems require moving parts like fans or pumps to circulate heat-carrying fluids.
* Passive systems have no mechanical components and rely on design features only to capture heat (e.g. greenhouses).  

The technologies are also grouped by temperature - low, medium or high[3].

* Low-temperature (<100°C) applications typically use solar thermal energy for hot water or space heating. Active systems often consist of a roof-mounted flat plate collector through which liquid circulates. The collector absorbs heat from the sun and the liquid carries it to the desired destination, for example a swimming pool or home heating system. Passive heating systems involve intelligent building design practices, which cut back on the need for heating or cooling systems by better capturing or reflecting solar energy. 
* Medium-temperature (100-250°C) applications are not common. An example would be a solar oven, which uses a specially-shaped reflector to focus the sun’s rays on a central cooking pot. Similar systems could be used for industrial processes, but are not widely used.
* High-temperature (250°C >) solar thermal systems use groups of mirrors to concentrate solar energy onto a central collector. These concentrated solar power (CSP) systems can reach temperatures high enough to produce steam, which then turns a turbine, driving a generator to produce electricity.

### Context

Solar thermal systems have several advantages. 
* The ‘fuel’ that powers them is free and renewable, so these systems are cheap to run and can replace some conventional fuel use.
* Solar thermal is an emission-free source of energy. 
* Finally, solar thermal systems are relatively low maintenance because they use simpler technologies and passive systems that have no moving parts. 
* In the case of CSP, the technology’s ability to produce large-scale generation is an advantage for regions that utilize a centralized electricity distribution system.
### Drawbacks
Although abundant, many aspects of sunlight can cause problems for the use of solar thermal systems. 
* Sunshine is not a very concentrated energy source, so it can take a large area to make a reasonable amount of energy, evoking land-use concerns.
* Sunshine is also intermittent and its availability is dependent on location.
* The location of CSP installations causes additional problems for the technology.  Many are normally located in remote, desert areas, and, given that steam turbines produce electricity for CSP, water access and rapid evaporation are key concerns for the viability of the technology.  
* In addition, transmission of electricity over large distances is expensive and can lead to distribution losses.
* Finally, practical challenges such as upfront capital costs and awareness of solar thermal technologies can also be barriers to implementation in some countries. 
## Solar Photovoltaics 
### What is Photovoltaics?
Photovoltaics is the direct conversion of light into electricity at the atomic level. Some materials exhibit a property known as the photoelectric effect that causes them to absorb photons of light and release electrons. When these free electrons are captured, an electric current results that can be used as electricity.

The photoelectric effect was first noted by a French physicist, Edmund Bequerel, in 1839, who found that certain materials would produce small amounts of electric current when exposed to light. In 1905, Albert Einstein described the nature of light and the photoelectric effect on which photovoltaic technology is based, for which he later won a Nobel prize in physics. The first photovoltaic module was built by Bell Laboratories in 1954. It was billed as a solar battery and was mostly just a curiosity as it was too expensive to gain widespread use. In the 1960s, the space industry began to make the first serious use of the technology to provide power aboard spacecraft. Through the space programs, the technology advanced, its reliability was established, and the cost began to decline. During the energy crisis in the 1970s, photovoltaic technology gained recognition as a source of power for non-space applications.

The diagram above illustrates the operation of a basic photovoltaic cell, also called a solar cell. Solar cells are made of the same kinds of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, used in the microelectronics industry. For solar cells, a thin semiconductor wafer is specially treated to form an electric field, positive on one side and negative on the other. When light energy strikes the solar cell, electrons are knocked loose from the atoms in the semiconductor material. If electrical conductors are attached to the positive and negative sides, forming an electrical circuit, the electrons can be captured in the form of an electric current -- that is, electricity. This electricity can then be used to power a load, such as a light or a tool.

A number of solar cells electrically connected to each other and mounted in a support structure or frame is called a photovoltaic module. Modules are designed to supply electricity at a certain voltage, such as a common 12 volts system. The current produced is directly dependent on how much light strikes the module.

![This](https://smd-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/science-red/s3fs-public/mnt/medialibrary/2002/01/01/solarcells_resources/array.gif)
Multiple modules can be wired together to form an array. In general, the larger the area of a module or array, the more electricity that will be produced. Photovoltaic modules and arrays produce direct-current (dc) electricity. They can be connected in both series and parallel electrical arrangements to produce any required voltage and current combination.

Today's most common PV devices use a single junction, or interface, to create an electric field within a semiconductor such as a PV cell. In a single-junction PV cell, only photons whose energy is equal to or greater than the band gap of the cell material can free an electron for an electric circuit. In other words, the photovoltaic response of single-junction cells is limited to the portion of the sun's spectrum whose energy is above the band gap of the absorbing material, and lower-energy photons are not used.
One way to get around this limitation is to use two (or more) different cells, with more than one band gap and more than one junction, to generate a voltage. These are referred to as "multijunction" cells (also called "cascade" or "tandem" cells). Multijunction devices can achieve a higher total conversion efficiency because they can convert more of the energy spectrum of light to electricity.

As shown below, a multijunction device is a stack of individual single-junction cells in descending order of band gap (Eg). The top cell captures the high-energy photons and passes the rest of the photons on to be absorbed by lower-band-gap cells.

### Current developments
For best performance, terrestrial PV systems aim to maximize the time they face the sun. Solar trackers achieve this by moving PV panels to follow the sun. The increase can be by as much as 20% in winter and by as much as 50% in summer. Static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the sun path. Panels are often set to latitude tilt, an angle equal to the latitude, but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter. Generally, as with other semiconductor devices, temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaics.

A number of solar panels may also be mounted vertically above each other in a tower, if the zenith distance of the Sun is greater than zero, and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis. In such a tower the panels can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a ladder mounted on a turnable disk. Each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular solar panel. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the "ladder" may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the polar star, meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth. In this case the angle between the axis and the Sun is always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (building-integrated photovoltaics).

## Wind Energy
Wind power is the use of air flow through wind turbines to provide the mechanical power to turn electric generators. Wind power, as an alternative to burning fossil fuels, is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, consumes no water, and uses little land. The net effects on the environment are far less problematic than those of fossil fuel sources.
### Wind farms
* It consist of many individual wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power transmission network. 
* Onshore wind(Turbines Located at Land) is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. 
* Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. 
* Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.

Wind power gives variable power, which is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales. It is therefore used in conjunction with other electric power sources to give a reliable supply. As the proportion of wind power in a region increases, a need to upgrade the grid and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur. Power-management techniques such as having excess capacity, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable sources, sufficient hydroelectric power, exporting and importing power to neighboring areas, energy storage, or reducing demand when wind production is low, can in many cases overcome these problems. Weather forecasting permits the electric-power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur.

In 2018, global wind power capacity expanded 9.6% to 591 GW.[16]. In 2017, yearly wind energy production grew 17% reaching 4.4% of worldwide electric power usage. At least 83 other countries around the world are using wind power to supply their electric power grids.
### Wind Energy in Nepal
 A 10 kw wind turbine generator was installed at Kagbeni in Mustang district, the trans Himalayan zone by Nepal electricity authority in 1985. But the turbine was broken by high wind after the installation and is now dismantled. 
 Some of the recently completed microwind energy projects in Nepal are: 
 * Kavre District (2 windmills with 400 watt capacity established in 2007), 
 * Biratnagar, Morang District (windmill for groundwater pumping), 
 * Bhimdhunga, Dhading Besi, Dhading District and 
 * Timal Danda, Kavre District (measurement of wind speed and potential for  electricity generation, established in 2008).
 #### Recent Datas
In Nepal, the wind velocities in low altitude valleys are lower in magnitude than those in the high altitude valleys and mountain ridges. This is evident from data observed in Kathmandu (low values) and Kaligandaki valleys (high values).
Nepal national building code NBC 104 :1994 on wind load has divided the whole country into two regions:
a. The lower plains and hills generally include the southern plains (Terai), Kathmandu Valley and areas generally below 3000 m altitude. Here the basic wind velocity of 47 m/s is adopted.
b. The second zone lies above 3000 m. Here the basic wind velocity of 55 m/s has been adopted.
##### ACTIVITIES IN THE PAST  YEARS

Nepal government has realized that wind energy could become a major source of alternative energy to solve energy crisis in the country. It is planning to generate 20 MW wind power generation from Kathmandu Valley and the surroundings hills. Charus Development Nepal Pvt. Ltd and two international companies, viz., Suzlon Energy Limited (India) and AGA Middle East Pvt. Ltd Singapore/Hong Kong have submitted proposals to the Government of Nepal for generating more than 200 MW wind energy. Charus Development Nepal Pvt. Ltd has already obtained from the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology for survey license to carry out detail feasibility study in Annapurna areas for generating 400 MW of electricity. 
### Wind Turbines 
Wind turbines are devices that convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power.

Wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs. Larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as **wind farms**, are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. One assessment claimed that, as of 2009, wind had the "lowest relative greenhouse gas emissions, the least water consumption demands and... the most favourable social impacts" compared to photovoltaic, hydro, geothermal, coal and gas. 
### Types
Wind turbines can rotate about either a horizontal or a vertical axis, the former being both older and more common. They can also include blades, or be bladeless. Vertical designs produce less power and are less common.
![This](http://i65.tinypic.com/ztixpu.gif)
#### HWAT
* Large three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT) with the blades upwind of the tower produce the overwhelming majority of wind power in the world today. These turbines have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower, and must be pointed into the wind.
* Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane, while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a yaw system.
* Most have a gearbox, which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator. 
* Some turbines use a different type of generator suited to slower rotational speed input. These don't need a gearbox, and are called direct-drive, meaning they couple the rotor directly to the generator with no gearbox in between.
* While permanent magnet direct-drive generators can be more costly due to the rare earth materials required, these gearless turbines are sometimes preferred over gearbox generators because they "eliminate the gear-speed increaser, which is susceptible to significant accumulated fatigue torque loading, related reliability issues, and maintenance costs."
* Most horizontal axis turbines have their rotors upwind of the supporting tower. Downwind machines have been built, because they don't need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind. In high winds, the blades can also be allowed to bend, which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance.
* Despite these advantages, upwind designs are preferred, because the change in loading from the wind as each blade passes behind the supporting tower can cause damage to the turbine.
* Turbines used in wind farms for commercial production of electric power are usually three-bladed.
* These have low torque ripple, which contributes to good reliability. The blades are usually colored white for daytime visibility by aircraft and range in length from 20 to 80 meters (66 to 262 ft). 
* Usual multi megawatt turbines have tubular steel towers with a height of 70 m to 120 m and in extremes up to 160 m.
### Vertical axis

* Vertical-axis wind turbines (or VAWTs) have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically.
* One advantage of this arrangement is that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective, which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable.
* It is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable. 
* Also, the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground, using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the ground-based gearbox, improving accessibility for maintenance. 
* However, these designs produce much less energy averaged over time, which is a major drawback.
* The key disadvantages include the relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train, the inherently lower power coefficient.
### Components
Wind turbines convert wind energy to electrical energy for distribution. Conventional horizontal axis turbines can be divided into three components:

* The rotor, which is approximately 20% of the wind turbine cost, includes the blades for converting wind energy to low speed rotational energy.
* The generator, which is approximately 34% of the wind turbine cost, includes the electrical generator, the control electronics, and most likely a gear box (e.g. planetary gear box), adjustable-speed drive or continuously variable transmission component for converting the low-speed incoming rotation to high-speed rotation suitable for generating electricity.
* The surrounding structure, which is approximately 15% of the wind turbine cost, includes the tower and rotor yaw mechanism.
### Comparison with fossil-fuel turbines
#### Advantages
* Wind turbines are generally inexpensive. They will produce electricity at between two and six cents per kilowatt hour, which is one of the lowest-priced renewable energy sources. As technology needed for wind turbines continues to improve, the prices will decrease as well. 
* In addition, there is no competitive market for wind energy, as it does not cost money to get a hold of wind. The main cost of wind turbines are the installation process.
* Wind turbines provide a clean energy source, emitting no greenhouse gases and no waste product. Over 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide per year can be eliminated by using a one megawatt turbine instead of one megawatt of energy from a fossil fuel.
* Being environmentally friendly and green is a large advantage of wind turbines.
### Disadvantages
* Wind turbines can be very large, reaching over 140 metres tall and with blades 55 metres long, and people have often complained about their visual impact.
* Environmental impact of wind power includes effect on wildlife, but can be mitigated if proper monitoring and mitigation strategies are implemented.
* Thousands of birds, including rare species, have been killed by the blades of wind turbines.
* Further, marine life is affected by water intakes of steam turbine cooling towers (heat exchangers) for nuclear and fossil fuel generators, by coal dust deposits in marine ecosystems (e.g. damaging Australia's Great Barrier Reef) and by water acidification from combustion monoxides.
* Energy harnessed by wind turbines is intermittent, and is not a "dispatchable" source of power; its availability is based on whether the wind is blowing, not whether electricity is needed. 
* Turbines can be placed on ridges or bluffs to maximize the access of wind they have, but this also limits the locations where they can be placed.

In this way, wind energy is not a particularly reliable source of energy. However, it can form part of the energy mix, which also includes power from other sources. Notably, the relative available output from wind and solar sources is often inversely proportional. Technology is also being developed to store excess energy, which can then make up for any deficits in supplies.
### Wind energy
It is the kinetic energy of air in motion, also called wind. Total wind energy flowing through an imaginary surface with area A during the time t is:
E = (1/2)*m*v^2
E = (1/2)*(Avtρ)*v^2
E = (1/2)*Atρv^3
where ρ is the density of air; v is the wind speed; Avt is the volume of air passing through A (which is considered perpendicular to the direction of the wind); Avtρ is therefore the mass m passing through "A". Note that ½ ρv2 is the kinetic energy of the moving air per unit volume.

Power is energy per unit time, so the wind power incident on A (e.g. equal to the rotor area of a wind turbine) is:

P = E/t = (1/2)*Aρv^3

Wind power in an open air stream is thus proportional to the third power of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Wind turbines for grid electric power therefore need to be especially efficient at greater wind speeds.

## GEO-THERMAL ENERGY
#### What is geothermal energy?
Geothermal energy is heat within the earth. The word geothermal comes from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat). Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because heat is continuously produced inside the earth. People use geothermal heat for bathing, to heat buildings, and to generate electricity.

The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials. The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface.

Geothermal power is cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly, but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries.

The Earth's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive.
### Extraction and Uses
One common way to use geothermal energy is by constructing bore wells into the Earth. To extract energy, holes are made deep into the earth with a drill machine. Then through a pipe, the hot steam rises to the top which is further channeled to a turbine to generate power.

It is a renewable source of energy because heat and steam are continuously produced underground which is available to us at anytime. There are two uses of geothermal energy, one is the direct use or application of the energy and other is electricity generation. The direct use involves generating heat or steam directly from underground resources without using a heat pump or a geothermal power plant. There are various fields that can extract geothermal energy for different purposes. The following are the fields in which this energy is prominently used:
* **In Industries**
   * Paper mills use geothermal energy for all paper processing stages. The heat generated from it is used for drying wood.
   * It is also used to extract precious metals like gold, silver, etc., from mines.
   * Timber is dried using the heat extracted from this energy. 
   * For preserving fruits and vegetables for longer time, they are dried up, i.e., the water contained in them is removed slowly. 
   * With geothermal drying, color, flavor and freshness of the food stay unaffected.
   * Even the nutritional value of the processed food is retained.

* **In Aquaculture and Agriculture**
  * Geothermal energy helps in raising marine life. 
  * The aquatic animals that are typically raised are carp, catfish, frogs, mussels, crabs, scallops, crayfish and oysters. Normally, marine organisms depend on heat coming from the sun to feed and perform metabolic activities.
  * When water temperature goes below a required level, it becomes difficult for aquatic animals to carry out these activities. So to overcome this difficulty, a geothermal water supply can be used. 
  * In agriculture it is mostly used for the purpose of green house heating. It is also used for drying and processing vegetables and fruits. Drying of vegetables specifically involves drying of tomato, onion, chilly, etc.
* **In Electricity Generation**
Generating electricity is one of the two major uses of geothermal energy. It is a very energy-efficient method to generate a source of renewable energy. It does not emit harmful gases while generating power. It is used to generate geothermal power to produce a very large amount of electricity.


The benefits of using geothermal energy are many, amongst which the important ones are:
* It is a renewable source of energy.
* It has low operating costs once the power generating system is available.
* The emission of gases while generating geothermal power is very low.
* It contributes in providing a pollution-free environment.
* Many industries worldwide, benefit by using this source of energy. Its uses are common in countries like Iceland.

Constant use of geothermal energy will definitely help to save the environment from the hazards that can be caused by using other non-renewable sources of energy. Though the installation costs are very high, it is useful if used with proper knowledge of its working system.

## Bio mass and Bio energy
Biomass is organic material that comes from plants and animals, and it is a renewable source of energy.

Biomass contains stored energy from the sun. Plants absorb the sun's energy in a process called photosynthesis. When biomass is burned, the chemical energy in biomass is released as heat. Biomass can be burned directly or converted to liquid biofuels or biogas that can be burned as fuels.
![This](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/photosynthesis1.gif)
Examples of biomass and their uses for energy:
* Wood and wood processing wastes—burned to heat buildings, to produce process heat in industry, and to generate electricity
* Agricultural crops and waste materials—burned as a fuel or converted to liquid biofuels
* Food, yard, and wood waste in garbage—burned to generate electricity in power plants or converted to biogas in landfills
* Animal manure and human sewage—converted to biogas, which can be burned as a fuel
