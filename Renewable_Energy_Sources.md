# Solar Energy
### Solar Radiation
Solar irradiance (SI) is the power per unit area received from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range of the measuring instrument. The solar irradiance integrated over time is called solar irradiation, insolation, or solar exposure. However, insolation is often used interchangeably with irradiance in practice.

Irradiance may be measured in space or at the Earth's surface after atmospheric absorption and scattering. Irradiance in space is a function of distance from the Sun, the solar cycle, and cross-cycle changes. Irradiance on the Earth's surface additionally depends on the tilt of the measuring surface, the height of the sun above the horizon, and atmospheric conditions. Solar irradiance affects plant metabolism and animal behavior.

The study and measurement of solar irradiance have several important applications, including the prediction of energy generation from solar power plants, the heating and cooling loads of buildings, and in climate modeling and weather forecasting.

There are several measured types of solar irradiance.

* **Total Solar Irradiance (TSI)** is a measure of the solar power over all wavelengths per unit area incident on the Earth's upper atmosphere. It is measured perpendicular to the incoming sunlight. The solar constant is a conventional measure of mean TSI at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU).

* **Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)**, or beam radiation, is measured at the surface of the Earth at a given location with a surface element perpendicular to the Sun. It excludes diffuse solar radiation (radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components). Direct irradiance is equal to the extraterrestrial irradiance above the atmosphere minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering. Losses depend on time of day (length of light's path through the atmosphere depending on the solar elevation angle), cloud cover, moisture content and other contents. The irradiance above the atmosphere also varies with time of year (because the distance to the sun varies), although this effect is generally less significant compared to the effect of losses on DNI.
* **Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)**, or Diffuse Sky Radiation is the radiation at the Earth's surface from light scattered by the atmosphere. It is measured on a horizontal surface with radiation coming from all points in the sky excluding circumsolar radiation (radiation coming from the sun disk). There would be almost no DHI in the absence of atmosphere.
* **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)** is the total irradiance from the sun on a horizontal surface on Earth. It is the sum of direct irradiance (after accounting for the solar zenith angle of the sun z) and diffuse horizontal irradiance:
 **GHI = DHI+DNI × cos(z)**

The SI unit of irradiance is watt per square metre (W/m2).

### Irradiance in the Earth Surface

Average annual solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is roughly 1361 W/m2. The Sun's rays are attenuated as they pass through the atmosphere, leaving maximum normal surface irradiance at approximately 1000 W /m2 at sea level on a clear day. When 1361 W/m2 is arriving above the atmosphere (when the sun is at the zenith in a cloudless sky), direct sun is about 1050 W/m2, and global radiation on a horizontal surface at ground level is about 1120 W/m2. The latter figure includes radiation scattered or reemitted by atmosphere and surroundings. The actual figure varies with the Sun's angle and atmospheric circumstances. Ignoring clouds, the daily average insolation for the Earth is approximately 6 kWh/m2 = 21.6 MJ/m2.

The output of, for example, a photovoltaic panel, partly depends on the angle of the sun relative to the panel. One Sun is a unit of power flux, not a standard value for actual insolation. Sometimes this unit is referred to as a Sol, not to be confused with a sol, meaning one solar day.

### Solar Thermal Energy
Solar thermal energy (STE) is a form of energy and a technology for harnessing solar energy to generate thermal energy or electrical energy for use in industry, and in the residential and commercial sectors.

Solar thermal technologies capture the heat energy from the sun and use it for heating and/or the production of electricity. This is different from photovoltaic solar panels, which directly convert the sun’s radiation to electricity.

There are two main types of solar thermal systems for energy production – active and passive.  
* Active systems require moving parts like fans or pumps to circulate heat-carrying fluids.
* Passive systems have no mechanical components and rely on design features only to capture heat (e.g. greenhouses).  

The technologies are also grouped by temperature - low, medium or high[3].

* Low-temperature (<100°C) applications typically use solar thermal energy for hot water or space heating. Active systems often consist of a roof-mounted flat plate collector through which liquid circulates. The collector absorbs heat from the sun and the liquid carries it to the desired destination, for example a swimming pool or home heating system. Passive heating systems involve intelligent building design practices, which cut back on the need for heating or cooling systems by better capturing or reflecting solar energy. 
* Medium-temperature (100-250°C) applications are not common. An example would be a solar oven, which uses a specially-shaped reflector to focus the sun’s rays on a central cooking pot. Similar systems could be used for industrial processes, but are not widely used.
* High-temperature (250°C >) solar thermal systems use groups of mirrors to concentrate solar energy onto a central collector. These concentrated solar power (CSP) systems can reach temperatures high enough to produce steam, which then turns a turbine, driving a generator to produce electricity.

### Context

Solar thermal systems have several advantages. 
* The ‘fuel’ that powers them is free and renewable, so these systems are cheap to run and can replace some conventional fuel use.
* Solar thermal is an emission-free source of energy. 
* Finally, solar thermal systems are relatively low maintenance because they use simpler technologies and passive systems that have no moving parts. 
* In the case of CSP, the technology’s ability to produce large-scale generation is an advantage for regions that utilize a centralized electricity distribution system.
### Drawbacks
Although abundant, many aspects of sunlight can cause problems for the use of solar thermal systems. 
* Sunshine is not a very concentrated energy source, so it can take a large area to make a reasonable amount of energy, evoking land-use concerns.
* Sunshine is also intermittent and its availability is dependent on location.
* The location of CSP installations causes additional problems for the technology.  Many are normally located in remote, desert areas, and, given that steam turbines produce electricity for CSP, water access and rapid evaporation are key concerns for the viability of the technology.  
* In addition, transmission of electricity over large distances is expensive and can lead to distribution losses.
* Finally, practical challenges such as upfront capital costs and awareness of solar thermal technologies can also be barriers to implementation in some countries. 
## Solar Photovoltaics 
### What is Photovoltaics?
Photovoltaics is the direct conversion of light into electricity at the atomic level. Some materials exhibit a property known as the photoelectric effect that causes them to absorb photons of light and release electrons. When these free electrons are captured, an electric current results that can be used as electricity.

The photoelectric effect was first noted by a French physicist, Edmund Bequerel, in 1839, who found that certain materials would produce small amounts of electric current when exposed to light. In 1905, Albert Einstein described the nature of light and the photoelectric effect on which photovoltaic technology is based, for which he later won a Nobel prize in physics. The first photovoltaic module was built by Bell Laboratories in 1954. It was billed as a solar battery and was mostly just a curiosity as it was too expensive to gain widespread use. In the 1960s, the space industry began to make the first serious use of the technology to provide power aboard spacecraft. Through the space programs, the technology advanced, its reliability was established, and the cost began to decline. During the energy crisis in the 1970s, photovoltaic technology gained recognition as a source of power for non-space applications.

![Nasa](https://smd-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/science-red/s3fs-public/styles/large/public/mnt/medialibrary/2002/01/01/solarcells_resources/cell.gif?itok=sm_36EdB)
The diagram above illustrates the operation of a basic photovoltaic cell, also called a solar cell. Solar cells are made of the same kinds of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, used in the microelectronics industry. For solar cells, a thin semiconductor wafer is specially treated to form an electric field, positive on one side and negative on the other. When light energy strikes the solar cell, electrons are knocked loose from the atoms in the semiconductor material. If electrical conductors are attached to the positive and negative sides, forming an electrical circuit, the electrons can be captured in the form of an electric current -- that is, electricity. This electricity can then be used to power a load, such as a light or a tool.

A number of solar cells electrically connected to each other and mounted in a support structure or frame is called a photovoltaic module. Modules are designed to supply electricity at a certain voltage, such as a common 12 volts system. The current produced is directly dependent on how much light strikes the module.

![This](https://smd-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/science-red/s3fs-public/mnt/medialibrary/2002/01/01/solarcells_resources/array.gif)
Multiple modules can be wired together to form an array. In general, the larger the area of a module or array, the more electricity that will be produced. Photovoltaic modules and arrays produce direct-current (dc) electricity. They can be connected in both series and parallel electrical arrangements to produce any required voltage and current combination.

Today's most common PV devices use a single junction, or interface, to create an electric field within a semiconductor such as a PV cell. In a single-junction PV cell, only photons whose energy is equal to or greater than the band gap of the cell material can free an electron for an electric circuit. In other words, the photovoltaic response of single-junction cells is limited to the portion of the sun's spectrum whose energy is above the band gap of the absorbing material, and lower-energy photons are not used.
One way to get around this limitation is to use two (or more) different cells, with more than one band gap and more than one junction, to generate a voltage. These are referred to as "multijunction" cells (also called "cascade" or "tandem" cells). Multijunction devices can achieve a higher total conversion efficiency because they can convert more of the energy spectrum of light to electricity.

As shown below, a multijunction device is a stack of individual single-junction cells in descending order of band gap (Eg). The top cell captures the high-energy photons and passes the rest of the photons on to be absorbed by lower-band-gap cells.
![This](https://smd-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/science-red/s3fs-public/mnt/medialibrary/2002/01/01/solarcells_resources/tunneljunction.gif)

### Current developments
For best performance, terrestrial PV systems aim to maximize the time they face the sun. Solar trackers achieve this by moving PV panels to follow the sun. The increase can be by as much as 20% in winter and by as much as 50% in summer. Static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the sun path. Panels are often set to latitude tilt, an angle equal to the latitude, but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter. Generally, as with other semiconductor devices, temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaics.

A number of solar panels may also be mounted vertically above each other in a tower, if the zenith distance of the Sun is greater than zero, and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis. In such a tower the panels can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a ladder mounted on a turnable disk. Each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular solar panel. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the "ladder" may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the polar star, meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth. In this case the angle between the axis and the Sun is always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (building-integrated photovoltaics).

## Wind Energy
Wind power is the use of air flow through wind turbines to provide the mechanical power to turn electric generators. Wind power, as an alternative to burning fossil fuels, is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, consumes no water, and uses little land. The net effects on the environment are far less problematic than those of fossil fuel sources.
### Wind farms
* It consist of many individual wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power transmission network. 
* Onshore wind(Turbines Located at Land) is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. 
* Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. 
* Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.

Wind power gives variable power, which is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales. It is therefore used in conjunction with other electric power sources to give a reliable supply. As the proportion of wind power in a region increases, a need to upgrade the grid and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur. Power-management techniques such as having excess capacity, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable sources, sufficient hydroelectric power, exporting and importing power to neighboring areas, energy storage, or reducing demand when wind production is low, can in many cases overcome these problems. Weather forecasting permits the electric-power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur.

In 2018, global wind power capacity expanded 9.6% to 591 GW.[16]. In 2017, yearly wind energy production grew 17% reaching 4.4% of worldwide electric power usage. At least 83 other countries around the world are using wind power to supply their electric power grids.
### Wind Energy in Nepal
 A 10 kw wind turbine generator was installed at Kagbeni in Mustang district, the trans Himalayan zone by Nepal electricity authority in 1985. But the turbine was broken by high wind after the installation and is now dismantled. 
 Some of the recently completed microwind energy projects in Nepal are: 
 * Kavre District (2 windmills with 400 watt capacity established in 2007), 
 * Biratnagar, Morang District (windmill for groundwater pumping), 
 * Bhimdhunga, Dhading Besi, Dhading District and 
 * Timal Danda, Kavre District (measurement of wind speed and potential for  electricity generation, established in 2008).
 #### Recent Datas
In Nepal, the wind velocities in low altitude valleys are lower in magnitude than those in the high altitude valleys and mountain ridges. This is evident from data observed in Kathmandu (low values) and Kaligandaki valleys (high values).
Nepal national building code NBC 104 :1994 on wind load has divided the whole country into two regions:
a. The lower plains and hills generally include the southern plains (Terai), Kathmandu Valley and areas generally below 3000 m altitude. Here the basic wind velocity of 47 m/s is adopted.
b. The second zone lies above 3000 m. Here the basic wind velocity of 55 m/s has been adopted.
##### ACTIVITIES IN THE PAST  YEARS

Nepal government has realized that wind energy could become a major source of alternative energy to solve energy crisis in the country. It is planning to generate 20 MW wind power generation from Kathmandu Valley and the surroundings hills. Charus Development Nepal Pvt. Ltd and two international companies, viz., Suzlon Energy Limited (India) and AGA Middle East Pvt. Ltd Singapore/Hong Kong have submitted proposals to the Government of Nepal for generating more than 200 MW wind energy. Charus Development Nepal Pvt. Ltd has already obtained from the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology for survey license to carry out detail feasibility study in Annapurna areas for generating 400 MW of electricity. 
### Wind Turbines 
Wind turbines are devices that convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power.

Wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs. Larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as **wind farms**, are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. One assessment claimed that, as of 2009, wind had the "lowest relative greenhouse gas emissions, the least water consumption demands and... the most favourable social impacts" compared to photovoltaic, hydro, geothermal, coal and gas. 
### Types
Wind turbines can rotate about either a horizontal or a vertical axis, the former being both older and more common. They can also include blades, or be bladeless. Vertical designs produce less power and are less common.
![This](http://i65.tinypic.com/ztixpu.gif)
#### HWAT
* Large three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT) with the blades upwind of the tower produce the overwhelming majority of wind power in the world today. These turbines have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower, and must be pointed into the wind.
* Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane, while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a yaw system.
* Most have a gearbox, which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator. 
* Some turbines use a different type of generator suited to slower rotational speed input. These don't need a gearbox, and are called direct-drive, meaning they couple the rotor directly to the generator with no gearbox in between.
* While permanent magnet direct-drive generators can be more costly due to the rare earth materials required, these gearless turbines are sometimes preferred over gearbox generators because they "eliminate the gear-speed increaser, which is susceptible to significant accumulated fatigue torque loading, related reliability issues, and maintenance costs."
* Most horizontal axis turbines have their rotors upwind of the supporting tower. Downwind machines have been built, because they don't need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind. In high winds, the blades can also be allowed to bend, which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance.
* Despite these advantages, upwind designs are preferred, because the change in loading from the wind as each blade passes behind the supporting tower can cause damage to the turbine.
* Turbines used in wind farms for commercial production of electric power are usually three-bladed.
* These have low torque ripple, which contributes to good reliability. The blades are usually colored white for daytime visibility by aircraft and range in length from 20 to 80 meters (66 to 262 ft). 
* Usual multi megawatt turbines have tubular steel towers with a height of 70 m to 120 m and in extremes up to 160 m.
### Vertical axis

* Vertical-axis wind turbines (or VAWTs) have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically.
* One advantage of this arrangement is that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective, which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable.
* It is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable. 
* Also, the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground, using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the ground-based gearbox, improving accessibility for maintenance. 
* However, these designs produce much less energy averaged over time, which is a major drawback.
* The key disadvantages include the relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train, the inherently lower power coefficient.
### Components
Wind turbines convert wind energy to electrical energy for distribution. Conventional horizontal axis turbines can be divided into three components:

* The rotor, which is approximately 20% of the wind turbine cost, includes the blades for converting wind energy to low speed rotational energy.
* The generator, which is approximately 34% of the wind turbine cost, includes the electrical generator, the control electronics, and most likely a gear box (e.g. planetary gear box), adjustable-speed drive or continuously variable transmission component for converting the low-speed incoming rotation to high-speed rotation suitable for generating electricity.
* The surrounding structure, which is approximately 15% of the wind turbine cost, includes the tower and rotor yaw mechanism.
### Comparison with fossil-fuel turbines
#### Advantages
* Wind turbines are generally inexpensive. They will produce electricity at between two and six cents per kilowatt hour, which is one of the lowest-priced renewable energy sources. As technology needed for wind turbines continues to improve, the prices will decrease as well. 
* In addition, there is no competitive market for wind energy, as it does not cost money to get a hold of wind. The main cost of wind turbines are the installation process.
* Wind turbines provide a clean energy source, emitting no greenhouse gases and no waste product. Over 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide per year can be eliminated by using a one megawatt turbine instead of one megawatt of energy from a fossil fuel.
* Being environmentally friendly and green is a large advantage of wind turbines.
### Disadvantages
* Wind turbines can be very large, reaching over 140 metres tall and with blades 55 metres long, and people have often complained about their visual impact.
* Environmental impact of wind power includes effect on wildlife, but can be mitigated if proper monitoring and mitigation strategies are implemented.
* Thousands of birds, including rare species, have been killed by the blades of wind turbines.
* Further, marine life is affected by water intakes of steam turbine cooling towers (heat exchangers) for nuclear and fossil fuel generators, by coal dust deposits in marine ecosystems (e.g. damaging Australia's Great Barrier Reef) and by water acidification from combustion monoxides.
* Energy harnessed by wind turbines is intermittent, and is not a "dispatchable" source of power; its availability is based on whether the wind is blowing, not whether electricity is needed. 
* Turbines can be placed on ridges or bluffs to maximize the access of wind they have, but this also limits the locations where they can be placed.

In this way, wind energy is not a particularly reliable source of energy. However, it can form part of the energy mix, which also includes power from other sources. Notably, the relative available output from wind and solar sources is often inversely proportional. Technology is also being developed to store excess energy, which can then make up for any deficits in supplies.
### Wind energy
It is the kinetic energy of air in motion, also called wind. Total wind energy flowing through an imaginary surface with area A during the time t is:
E = (1/2)*m*v^2
E = (1/2)*(Avtρ)*v^2
E = (1/2)*Atρv^3
where ρ is the density of air; v is the wind speed; Avt is the volume of air passing through A (which is considered perpendicular to the direction of the wind); Avtρ is therefore the mass m passing through "A". Note that ½ ρv2 is the kinetic energy of the moving air per unit volume.

Power is energy per unit time, so the wind power incident on A (e.g. equal to the rotor area of a wind turbine) is:

P = E/t = (1/2)*Aρv^3

Wind power in an open air stream is thus proportional to the third power of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Wind turbines for grid electric power therefore need to be especially efficient at greater wind speeds.

## GEO-THERMAL ENERGY
#### What is geothermal energy?
Geothermal energy is heat within the earth. The word geothermal comes from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat). Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because heat is continuously produced inside the earth. People use geothermal heat for bathing, to heat buildings, and to generate electricity.

The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials. The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface.

Geothermal power is cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly, but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries.

The Earth's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive.
### Extraction and Uses
One common way to use geothermal energy is by constructing bore wells into the Earth. To extract energy, holes are made deep into the earth with a drill machine. Then through a pipe, the hot steam rises to the top which is further channeled to a turbine to generate power.

It is a renewable source of energy because heat and steam are continuously produced underground which is available to us at anytime. There are two uses of geothermal energy, one is the direct use or application of the energy and other is electricity generation. The direct use involves generating heat or steam directly from underground resources without using a heat pump or a geothermal power plant. There are various fields that can extract geothermal energy for different purposes. The following are the fields in which this energy is prominently used:
* **In Industries**
   * Paper mills use geothermal energy for all paper processing stages. The heat generated from it is used for drying wood.
   * It is also used to extract precious metals like gold, silver, etc., from mines.
   * Timber is dried using the heat extracted from this energy. 
   * For preserving fruits and vegetables for longer time, they are dried up, i.e., the water contained in them is removed slowly. 
   * With geothermal drying, color, flavor and freshness of the food stay unaffected.
   * Even the nutritional value of the processed food is retained.

* **In Aquaculture and Agriculture**
  * Geothermal energy helps in raising marine life. 
  * The aquatic animals that are typically raised are carp, catfish, frogs, mussels, crabs, scallops, crayfish and oysters. Normally, marine organisms depend on heat coming from the sun to feed and perform metabolic activities.
  * When water temperature goes below a required level, it becomes difficult for aquatic animals to carry out these activities. So to overcome this difficulty, a geothermal water supply can be used. 
  * In agriculture it is mostly used for the purpose of green house heating. It is also used for drying and processing vegetables and fruits. Drying of vegetables specifically involves drying of tomato, onion, chilly, etc.
* **In Electricity Generation**
Generating electricity is one of the two major uses of geothermal energy. It is a very energy-efficient method to generate a source of renewable energy. It does not emit harmful gases while generating power. It is used to generate geothermal power to produce a very large amount of electricity.


The benefits of using geothermal energy are many, amongst which the important ones are:
* It is a renewable source of energy.
* It has low operating costs once the power generating system is available.
* The emission of gases while generating geothermal power is very low.
* It contributes in providing a pollution-free environment.
* Many industries worldwide, benefit by using this source of energy. Its uses are common in countries like Iceland.

Constant use of geothermal energy will definitely help to save the environment from the hazards that can be caused by using other non-renewable sources of energy. Though the installation costs are very high, it is useful if used with proper knowledge of its working system.

## Bio mass and Bio energy
Biomass is organic material that comes from plants and animals, and it is a renewable source of energy.

Biomass contains stored energy from the sun. Plants absorb the sun's energy in a process called photosynthesis. When biomass is burned, the chemical energy in biomass is released as heat. Biomass can be burned directly or converted to liquid biofuels or biogas that can be burned as fuels.
![This](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/photosynthesis1.gif)
Examples of biomass and their uses for energy:
* Wood and wood processing wastes—burned to heat buildings, to produce process heat in industry, and to generate electricity
* Agricultural crops and waste materials—burned as a fuel or converted to liquid biofuels
* Food, yard, and wood waste in garbage—burned to generate electricity in power plants or converted to biogas in landfills
* Animal manure and human sewage—converted to biogas, which can be burned as a fuel

![That](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/BIOMASSTYPES.jpg)
#### Converting biomass to energy
Solid biomass, such as wood and garbage, can be burned directly to produce heat. Biomass can also be converted into a gas called biogas or into liquid biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. These fuels can then be burned for energy.

Biogas forms when paper, food scraps, and yard waste decompose in landfills, and it can be produced by processing sewage and animal manure in special vessels called digesters.

Ethanol is made from crops such as corn and sugar cane that are fermented to produce fuel ethanol for use in vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils and animal fats and can be used in vehicles and as heating oil.
### Biomass Energy
 

The energy stored in biomass can be released to produce renewable electricity or heat. Biopower can be generated through combustion or gasification of dry biomass or biogas (methane) captured through controlled anaerobic digestion. Cofiring of biomass and fossil fuels (usually coal) is a low-cost means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving cost-effectiveness, and reducing air pollutants in existing power plants. Thermal energy (heating and cooling) is often produced at the scale of the individual building, through direct combustion of wood pellets, wood chips, and other sources of dry biomass.

Combined heat and power (CHP) operations often represent the most efficient use of biomass (utilizing around 80 percent of potential energy). These facilities capture the waste heat and/or steam from biopower production and pipe it to nearby buildings to provide heat or to chillers for cooling.
#### Biofuels
 

A number of transportation fuels can be produced from biomass, helping to alleviate demand for petroleum products and improve the greenhouse gas emissions profile of the transportation sector. Ethanol from corn and sugarcane, and biodiesel from soy, rapeseed, and oil palm dominate the current market for biofuels, but a number of companies are moving forward aggressively to develop and market a number of advanced second-generation biofuels made from non-food feedstocks, such as municipal waste, algae, perennial grasses, and wood chips. These fuels include cellulosic ethanol, bio-butanol, methanol and a number of synthetic gasoline/diesel equivalents. Until we are able to produce a significant amount of electric vehicles that run on renewably-produced electricity, biofuels remain the only widely available source of clean, renewable transportation energy.
### Synthetic fuels from the biomass
![That](http://weben.dede.go.th/webmax/sites/default/files/13_2.png)
Synthetic fuel or synfuel is a liquid fuel, or sometimes gaseous fuel, obtained from syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in which the syngas was derived from gasification of solid feedstocks such as coal or biomass or by reforming of natural gas.

Common methods for manufacturing synthetic fuels include the Fischer–Tropsch conversion, methanol to gasoline conversion, or direct coal liquefaction.

Synthetic fuels are produced by the chemical process of conversion. Conversion methods could be direct conversion into liquid transportation fuels, or indirect conversion, in which the source substance is converted initially into syngas which then goes through additional conversion process to become liquid fuels. Basic conversion methods include carbonization and pyrolysis, hydrogenation, and thermal dissolution.
### Waste-To-Energy Conversion
Waste-to-energy is the use of modern combustion and biological technologies to recover energy from urban wastes. There are three major waste to energy conversion routes – thermochemical, biochemical and physico-chemical. Thermochemical conversion, characterized by higher temperature and conversion rates, is best suited for lower moisture feedstock and is generally less selective for products. On the other hand, biochemical technologies are more suitable for wet wastes which are rich in organic matter.

#### Thermochemical Conversion
The three principal methods of thermochemical conversion are 
* combustion in excess air, 
* gasification in reduced air, and 
* pyrolysis in the absence of air.

The most common technique for producing both heat and electrical energy from household wastes is direct combustion.
Combined heat and power (CHP) or cogeneration systems, ranging from small-scale technology to large grid-connected facilities, provide significantly higher efficiencies than systems that only generate electricity.
![This](https://i0.wp.com/www.bioenergyconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Waste_Pathways.jpg?w=849&ssl=1)
Combustion technology is the controlled combustion of waste with the recovery of heat to produce steam which in turn produces power through steam turbines. Pyrolysis and gasification represent refined thermal treatment methods as alternatives to incineration and are characterized by the transformation of the waste into product gas as energy carrier for later combustion in, for example, a boiler or a gas engine. Plasma gasification, which takes place at extremely high temperature, is also hogging limelight nowadays.
### Biochemical Conversion
Biochemical processes, like anaerobic digestion, can also produce clean energy in the form of biogas which can be converted to power and heat using a gas engine. Anaerobic digestion is the natural biological process which stabilizes organic waste in the absence of air and transforms it into biofertilizer and biogas.

Anaerobic digestion is a reliable technology for the treatment of wet, organic waste.  Organic waste from various sources is biochemically degraded in highly controlled, oxygen-free conditions circumstances resulting in the production of biogas which can be used to produce both electricity and heat.

In addition, a variety of fuels can be produced from waste resources including liquid fuels, such as ethanol, methanol, biodiesel, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and gaseous fuels, such as hydrogen and methane. The resource base for biofuel production is composed of a wide variety of forestry and agricultural resources, industrial processing residues, and municipal solid and urban wood residues. Globally, biofuels are most commonly used to power vehicles, heat homes, and for cooking.

### Physico-chemical Conversion
The physico-chemical technology involves various processes to improve physical and chemical properties of solid waste. The combustible fraction of the waste is converted into high-energy fuel pellets which may be used in steam generation. The waste is first dried to bring down the high moisture levels. Sand, grit, and other incombustible matter are then mechanically separated before the waste is compacted and converted into fuel pellets or RDF.

Fuel pellets have several distinct advantages over coal and wood because it is cleaner, free from incombustibles, has lower ash and moisture contents, is of uniform size, cost-effective, and eco-friendly.
##  Biofuel cell
A biofuel cell uses living organisms to produce electricity. 
### Microbial fuel cell 
  * A microbial fuel cell (MFC), or biological fuel cell, is a bio-electrochemical system that drives an electric current by using bacteria and mimicking bacterial interactions found in nature. MFCs can be grouped into two general categories: mediated and unmediated. 
  * A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a device that converts chemical energy to electrical energy by the action of microorganisms.
  * These electrochemical cells are constructed using either a bioanode and/or a biocathode. Most MFCs contain a membrane to separate the compartments of the anode (where oxidation takes place) and the cathode (where reduction takes place). 
  * The electrons produced during oxidation are transferred directly to an electrode or, to a redox mediator species. The electron flux is moved to the cathode. The charge balance of the system is compensated by ionic movement inside the cell, usually across an ionic membrane. 
  * Most MFCs use an organic electron donor that is oxidized to produce CO2, protons and electrons. Other electron donors have been reported, such as sulphur compounds or hydrogen.
  * The cathode reaction uses a variety of electron acceptors that includes the reduction of oxygen as the most studied process. 
  ##### Power generation
MFCs are attractive for power generation applications that require only low power, but where replacing batteries may be impractical, such as wireless sensor networks.

Virtually any organic material could be used to feed the fuel cell, including coupling cells to wastewater treatment plants. Chemical process wastewater[18][19] and synthetic wastewater[20][21] have been used to produce bioelectricity in dual- and single-chamber mediatorless MFCs (uncoated graphite electrodes).

In theory, an MFC is capable of energy efficiency far beyond 50%. 

MFCs operate well in mild conditions, 20 °C to 40 °C and also at pH of around 7. They lack the stability required for long-term medical applications such as in pacemakers.

Power stations can be based on aquatic plants such as algae. If sited adjacent to an existing power system, the MFC system can share its electricity lines.
## Enzymatic biofuel cell
It is a specific type of fuel cell that uses enzymes as a catalyst to oxidize its fuel, rather than precious metals. Enzymatic biofuel cells, while currently confined to research facilities, are widely prized for the promise they hold in terms of their relatively inexpensive components and fuels, as well as a potential power source for bionic implants.
#### Operations
* Enzymatic biofuel cells work on the same general principles as all fuel cells: use a catalyst to separate electrons from a parent molecule and force it to go around an electrolyte barrier through a wire to generate an electric current. 
* What makes the enzymatic biofuel cell distinct from more conventional fuel cells are the catalysts they use and the fuels that they accept.
* Whereas most fuel cells use metals like platinum and nickel as catalysts, the enzymatic biofuel cell uses enzymes derived from living cells (although not within living cells; fuel cells that use whole cells to catalyze fuel are called microbial fuel cells). 
* This offers a couple of advantages for enzymatic biofuel cells: Enzymes are relatively easy to mass-produce and so benefit from economies of scale, whereas precious metals must be mined and so have an inelastic supply. 
* Enzymes are also specifically designed to process organic compounds such as sugars and alcohols, which are extremely common in nature. 
* Most organic compounds cannot be used as fuel by fuel cells with metal catalysts because the carbon monoxide formed by the interaction of the carbon molecules with oxygen during the fuel cell’s functioning will quickly “poison” the precious metals that the cell relies on, rendering it useless.
## Hydrogen Energy and Fuel Cell
#### proton-exchange membrane, or polymer-electrolyte membrane (PEM)
A proton-exchange membrane, or polymer-electrolyte membrane (PEM), is a semipermeable membrane generally made from ionomers and designed to conduct protons while acting as an electronic insulator and reactant barrier, e.g. to oxygen and hydrogen gas. This is their essential function when incorporated into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell or of a proton-exchange membrane electrolyser: separation of reactants and transport of protons while blocking a direct electronic pathway through the membrane.

PEMs can be made from either pure polymer membranes or from composite membranes, where other materials are embedded in a polymer matrix. One of the most common and commercially available PEM materials is the fluoropolymer (PFSA) Nafion, a DuPont product.  While Nafion is an ionomer with a perfluorinated backbone like Teflon, there are many other structural motifs used to make ionomers for proton-exchange membranes. Many use polyaromatic polymers, while others use partially fluorinated polymers.

Proton-exchange membranes are primarily characterized by proton conductivity (σ), methanol permeability (P), and thermal stability.

PEM fuel cells use a solid polymer membrane (a thin plastic film) as the electrolyte. This polymer is permeable to protons when it is saturated with water, but it does not conduct electrons.

### A solid oxide fuel cell (or SOFC)
It is an electrochemical conversion device that produces electricity directly from oxidizing a fuel. Fuel cells are characterized by their electrolyte material; the SOFC has a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte.

Advantages of this class of fuel cells include high efficiency, long-term stability, fuel flexibility, low emissions, and relatively low cost. The largest disadvantage is the high operating temperature which results in longer start-up times and mechanical and chemical compatibility issues.
![pic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Solid_oxide_fuel_cell.svg)

Solid oxide fuel cells are a class of fuel cells characterized by the use of a solid oxide material as the electrolyte. SOFCs use a solid oxide electrolyte to conduct negative oxygen ions from the cathode to the anode. The electrochemical oxidation of the oxygen ions with hydrogen or carbon monoxide thus occurs on the anode side.

They operate at very high temperatures, typically between 500 and 1,000 °C. 

Solid oxide fuel cells have a wide variety of applications, from use as auxiliary power units in vehicles to stationary power generation with outputs from 100 W to 2 MW.  The higher operating temperature make SOFCs suitable candidates for application with heat engine energy recovery devices or combined heat and power, which further increases overall fuel efficiency.

### Operation
A solid oxide fuel cell is made up of four layers, three of which are ceramics (hence the name). A single cell consisting of these four layers stacked together is typically only a few millimeters thick. Hundreds of these cells are then connected in series to form what most people refer to as an "SOFC stack". The ceramics used in SOFCs do not become electrically and ionically active until they reach very high temperature and as a consequence, the stacks have to run at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1,000 °C. Reduction of oxygen into oxygen ions occurs at the cathode. These ions can then diffuse through the solid oxide electrolyte to the anode where they can electrochemically oxidize the fuel. In this reaction, a water byproduct is given off as well as two electrons. These electrons then flow through an external circuit where they can do work. The cycle then repeats as those electrons enter the cathode material again.
### Hydrogen Production 
Hydrogen might be the most abundant element on earth but it can be found rarely in its pure form. Practically, this fact means that in order to produce hydrogen, it needs to be extracted from its compound. 
Of course, this extraction process needs energy but hydrogen can be produced or extracted using virtually any primary source of energy, be it fossil or renewable. Characteristically, hydrogen can be produced using diverse resources including fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal, biomass, non-food crops, nuclear energy and renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, and hydroelectric power to split water. This diversity of potential supply sources is THE most important reason why hydrogen is such a promising energy carrier. 
Although most of the world’s hydrogen production today is being produced through a more CO2 intensive process called Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), hydrogen can also be produced through a process that makes use of renewable electricity, leading to the production of “green” or CO2 neutral hydrogen. 

![Framework](https://hydrogeneurope.eu/sites/default/files/inline-images/Shell_H2_Study_all_graphs_No_6.jpg)

The current (new methods are being researched every day) most notable production pathways are the following:
#### Electrolysis and high temperature Electrolysis 
##### Method: Electrolysis
In short: Process where water (H2O) is split into hydrogen (H2 ) and oxygen (O2) gas with energy input and heat in the case of high temperature Electrolysis. 
In Practice: An electric current splits water into its constituent parts. If renewable energy is used, the gas has a zero-carbon footprint, and is known as green hydrogen.

![This](https://hydrogeneurope.eu/sites/default/files/inline-images/Electrolyser.png)

Despite the fact that hydrogen can be produced in numerous ways, the most interesting but also promising part is the production of hydrogen through electrolysis of water. 

In this process, the electrolysis breaks down water into hydrogen and oxygen by using electricity. If the electricity used, springs from renewable energy sources like wind or solar and the hydrogen produced is used in a fuel cell, then the entire energy process would create no net emissions. In this case, we would be talking about “green hydrogen”.

The electrolyser consists of a DC source and two noblemetal-coated electrodes, which are separated by an electrolyte. The electrolyte or ionic conductor can be a liquid, for example conductive caustic potash solution (potassium hydroxide, KOH) for alkaline electrolysis.
In an alkaline electrolyser the cathode (negative pole) loses electrons to the aqueous solution.

The water is dissociated, leading to the formation of hydrogen (H2) and hydroxide ions (OH –
The charge carriers move in the electrolyte towards the anode. At the anode (positive pole) the electrons are absorbed by the negative OH – anions. The OH – anions are oxidised to form water and oxygen. Oxygen rises at the anode. A membrane prevents the product gases H2 and O2 from mixing but allows the passage of OH – ions. Electrolysers consist of individual cells and central system units (balance of plant). By combining electrolytic cells and stacks, hydrogen production can be adapted to individual needs.

Electrolysers are differentiated by the electrolyte materials and the temperature at which they are operated: low-temperature electrolysis (LTE), including alkaline electrolysis (AE), proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis (also known as alkaline PEM), and high-temperature electrolysis (HTE). The latter group most notably includes solid oxide electrolysis (SOE), but this is still at an advanced R&D stage and products are not yet commercially available. Once it reaches market maturity, its advantages are expected to include increased conversion efficiency and the possibility of producing a synthesis gas directly from steam and CO 2 , for use in various applications such as synthetic liquid fuels (E4tech 2014, IEA 2015b).

High temperature electrolysis is particularly interesting when there is a source of heat next to the electrolyser (as it is often the case in industrial plants or )  is more efficient economically than traditional room-temperature electrolysis. Indeed some of the energy is supplied as heat, which is either free or cheaper than electricity, and also because the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher temperatures . 
The choice of a given electrolysis technology depends on the use needs and the local context.

Hydrogen is like electricity in the sense that its use does not generate any emission. Its carbon footprint is related to its production mode. In the case of hydrogen produced by electrolysis, its carbon footprint of hydrogen is directly related with the source of electricity. Hydrogen produced from carbon free renewable or nuclear electricity is therefore carbon free.  Hydrogen produced with the grid mix has the same carbon intensity as the grid mix.


#### Steam Methane Reforming:
##### Method: Reforming  
In short: The primary ways in which natural gas, mostly methane, is converted to hydrogen involve reaction with either steam (steam reforming or steam methane reforming SMR when methane is used), oxygen (partial oxidation), or both in sequence (autothermal reforming)
In practice: Steam reforming: Pure water vapour is used as the oxidant. The reaction requires the introduction of heat (“endothermic”).

* Partial oxidation: Oxygen or air is used in this method. The process releases heat (“exothermic”).
* Autothermal reforming: This process is a combination of steam reforming and partial oxidation and operates with a mixture of air and water vapour. The ratio of the two oxidants is adjusted so that no heat needs to be introduced or discharged (“isothermal”).

![ok](https://hydrogeneurope.eu/sites/default/files/inline-images/reform.png)

As already described above, currently, most of the hydrogen produced today, is being produced through the CO2 intensive process called Steam Methane Reforming. 
High-temperature steam (700°C–1,000°C) is used to produce hydrogen from a methane source, such as natural gas. In steam-methane reforming, methane reacts with steam under 3–25 bar pressure (1 bar = 14.5 psi) in the presence of a catalyst to produce hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and a relatively small amount of carbon dioxide. Steam reforming is endothermic—that is, heat must be supplied to the process for the reaction to proceed.
Subsequently, in what is called the "water-gas shift reaction," the carbon monoxide and steam are reacted using a catalyst to produce carbon dioxide and more hydrogen. In a final process step called "pressure-swing adsorption," carbon dioxide and other impurities are removed from the gas stream, leaving essentially pure hydrogen. Steam reforming can also be used to produce hydrogen from other fuels, such as ethanol, propane, or even gasoline.
For chemists:
Steam-methane reforming reaction
CH4 + H2O (+ heat) → CO + 3H2

Water-gas shift reaction
CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 (+ small amount of heat)

### Hydrogen as a By-Product or Industrial Residual Hydrogen 
###### Method: Hydrogen from other industrial processes that create hydrogen as a by-product
In Short: Electrochemical processes, such as the industrial production of caustic soda and chlorine produce hydrogen as a waste product.
In Practice: Producing chlorine and caustic soda comes down to passing an electric current through brine (a solution of salt – sodium chloride – in water). The brine dissociates and recombines through exchange of electrons (delivered by the current) into gaseous chlorine, dissolved caustic soda1 and hydrogen. By the nature of the chemical reaction, chlorine, caustic soda and hydrogen are always manufactured in a fixed ratio: 1.1 tonne of caustic and 0.03 tonne of hydrogen per tonne of chlorine.

### Hydrogen Storage
Batteries are not suitable in storing large amounts of electricity over time. A major advantage of hydrogen is that it can be produced from (surplus) renewable energies, and unlike electricity it can also be stored in large amounts for extended periods of time. For that reason, hydrogen produced on an industrial scale could play an important part in the energy transition.
However, hydrogen can complement batteries in the transport sector The optimal energy storage system for vehicles lies in hydrogen and battery systems. The hydrogen system would provide the bulk energy storage, while a relatively small energy capacity battery would allow regenerative braking, meet peak power demands, and generally buffer the fuel cell against load changes to extend its lifetime. This complementary use of hydrogen and battery storage is precisely the arrangement employed by Honda in its FCX Clarity hydrogen car that is now available commercially in limited numbers. 
Alongside other demand and supply measures, energy storage can play an important part in improved system integration. Short-term electricity storage in batteries for small plants is developing dynamically, however, longer-term storage of larger surplus amounts of electricity requires new types of storage, such as chemical storage in the form of hydrogen.
![Storage](https://hydrogeneurope.eu/sites/default/files/inline-images/bat.png)

Hydrogen can be obtained by electrolysis from electricity produced with surplus renewables. If there is a corresponding energy demand, the hydrogen can fulfil it directly. However, it can also be stored in bulk tanks as pressurised gas and retrieved when supplies are low.

Hydrogen can be utilized several ways as an energy carrier, such as feeding it in small amounts into the natural gas network; converting it to CH4 and introduce the obtained methane into the natural gas network; or the stored hydrogen can be directly converted back into electricity via fuel cells.

Hydrogen as an energy carrier has by far the highest gravimetric energy density The mass-based energy density of hydrogen is thus almost three times higher than that of liquid hydrocarbons, however, the volumetric energy density of hydrogen is comparatively low. Therefore, for practical handling purposes, the density of hydrogen must be increased significantly for storage purposes.

The most important hydrogen storage methods, which have been tried and tested over lengthy periods of time, include physical storage methods based on either compression or cooling or a combination of the two (hybrid storage). In addition, a large number of other new hydrogen storage technologies are being pursued or investigated. These technologies can be grouped together under the name materials-based storage technologies. These can include solids, liquids or surfaces. 

![Str](https://hydrogeneurope.eu/sites/default/files/inline-images/storage.png)
#### Liquefied Hydrogen
As well as storing gaseous hydrogen under pressure, it is also possible to store cryogenic hydrogen in the liquid state. Liquid hydrogen (LH2) is in demand today in applications requiring high levels of purity, such as in the chip industry for example. Tanks for LH2 are used today primarily in space travel.

#### Materials-Based h2 Storage
An alternative to physical storage methods is provided by hydrogen storage in solids and liquids and on surfaces.  Materials-based hydrogen storage media can be divided into three classes: first, hydride storage systems; second, liquid hydrogen carriers; and third, surface storage systems, which take up hydrogen by adsorption, i.e. attachment to the surface.

#### Hydride storage systems
In metal hydride storage systems the hydrogen forms interstitial compounds with metals. Here molecular hydrogen is first adsorbed on the metal surface and then incorporated in elemental form (H) into the metallic lattice with heat output and released again with heat input. Metal hydrides are based on elemental metals such as palladium, magnesium and lanthanum, intermetallic compounds, light metals such as aluminium, or certain alloys. Palla­dium, for example, can absorb a hydrogen gas volume up to 900 times its own volume.

#### Liquid organic hydrogen carriers
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers represent another option for binding hydrogen chemically. They are chemical compounds with high hydrogen absorption capacities. They currently include, in particular, the carbazole derivative N-ethylcarbazole, but also toluene

#### Surface storage systems (sorbents)
Finally, hydrogen can be stored as a sorbate by attachment (adsorption) on materials with high specific surface areas. Such sorption materials include, among others, microporous organometallic framework compounds (metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)), microporous crystalline aluminosilicates (zeolites) or microscopically small carbon nanotubes. Adsorption materials in powder form can achieve high volumetric storage densities.

#### Underground Storage
When it comes to the industrial storage of hydrogen, salt caverns, exhausted oil and gas fields or aquifers can be used as underground stores. Although being more expensive, cavern storage facilities are most suitable for hydrogen storage. Underground stores have been used for many years for natural gas and crude oil/oil products, which are stored in bulk to balance seasonal supply/demand fluctuations or for crisis preparedness.



#### Gas Grid
Another possibility for storing surplus renewable energy in the form of hydrogen is to feed it into the public natural gas network (Hydrogen Enriched Natural Gas or HENG).

## Coal Fired Plants
Coal fired power plants are a type of power plant that make use of the combustion of coal in order to generate electricity. Their use provides around 40% of the world's electricity and they are primarily used in developing countries.

The conversion of this coal to the end goal of electricity is a multi-faceted process:

* The coal must be unloaded from the train. Traditional ways of doing this require the use of cranes picking up the coal from the cars, however newer plants have the floor underneath the train tracks drop away, allowing the coal to be dropped into underground containment. Doing so doesn't even require the train to stop moving
* Once unloaded, the coal is then pulverized into a fine powder by a large grinder. This ensures nearly complete burning of the coal in order to maximize the heat given off and to minimize pollutants.
* The pulverized coal is then input to a boiler, where combustion occurs and the coal provides heat to the power plant. This heat is transferred to pipes containing high pressured water, which boils to steam.
* The steam then travels through a turbine, causing it to rotate extremely fast which in turn spins a generator, producing electricity. The electricity can then be input to the electrical grid for use by society.

Coal fired power plants follow the Rankine cycle in order to complete this process. Since they require plenty of water to be circulated in this cycle, coal power plants need to be located near a body of water.

### World Situations

![t](http://i67.tinypic.com/15dxb8n.png)

## Integrated Gassifier Fuel Cell (IGFC) systems
Lower-temperature fuel cell types such as the proton exchange membrane fuel cell, phosphoric acid fuel cell, and alkaline fuel cell require pure hydrogen as fuel, typically produced from external reforming of natural gas. However, fuels cells operating at high temperature such as the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) are not poisoned by carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and in fact can accept hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam, and methane mixtures as fuel directly, because of their internal shift and reforming capabilities. This opens up the possibility of efficient fuel cell-based power cycles consuming solid fuels such as coal and biomass, the gasification of which results in syngas containing mostly hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane which can be cleaned and fed directly to the SOFCs without the added cost and complexity of methane reforming, water gas shifting and hydrogen separation operations which would otherwise be needed to isolate pure hydrogen as fuel. A power cycle based on gasification of solid fuel and SOFCs is called an Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell (IGFC) cycle; the IGFC power plant is analogous to an integrated gasification combined cycle power plant, but with the gas turbine power generation unit replaced with a fuel cell (high temperature type such as SOFC) power generation unit. By taking advantage of intrinsically high energy efficiency of SOFCs and process integration, exceptionally high power plant efficiencies are possible. Furthermore, SOFCs in the IGFC cycle can be operated so as to isolate a carbon dioxide-rich anodic exhaust stream, allowing efficient carbon capture to address greenhouse gas emissions concerns of coal-based power generation.
## Hydro Powers
Water energy resources include hydroelectric power from lakes and rivers, ocean energy in its various forms, and energy technologies that take advantage of saline water.
#### Hydroelectric Power

Hydropower makes use of the kinetic energy water gains when it drops in elevation. Typically, water dammed in a lake or reservoir is released through turbines and generators to produce electricity, Hydropower has been a staple of electricity since the beginnings of the electric age. However, very little of this potential is currently slated for development. Significant legal and regulatory impediments, such as land acquisition and environmental protection, will be a part of any major hydro project. Additionally, reservoirs are typically built and managed as municipal water supply and flood control systems and secondarily for power production. This fact lowers the potential impact of hydro development on the energy picture.

#### Ocean Energy

Three distinct types of ocean resource are commonly mentioned as possible energy sources: tides, waves, and ocean temperature differentials (ocean thermal energy conversion, or OTEC). For example, tidal energy schemes capture water at high tide and release it at low tide. Wave energy generation devices fall into two general classifications, fixed and floating. In both cases, the oscillating motion of an incoming and outgoing wave is used to drive turbines that generate electricuty. Tide energy systems traps high tides in a reservoir. When the tide drops, the water behind the reservoir flows through a power turbine, generating electricity. Ocean thermal energy conversion uses the difference in temperature between warm surface water and cold deep ocean water to make electricity.

#### Saline Water

Saline and brackish water is common - normally it poses a problem for fresh water supplies. Several technologies, however, can take advantage of saline water for energy production. These include solar ponds and algae production. Solar ponds use the salt water in such a manner that heat from sunlight is effectively locked in the pool and can be used for a number of process heat applications or electricity production. The ability of the pond to store solar thermal energy is unique and overcomes the resource variability that is a drawback of traditional solar development. Salt water algaes grow prolifically under cultivated conditions and can be pressed to extract biodiesel feedstocks or dried and burned for power production. Although neither technology has been demonstrated beyond pilot levels, Texas is fortunate in that regions with saline water resources also tend to be very sunny. If coupled with ongoing fresh water chloride control efforts, exploitation of the saline water resource for energy production may be possible for modest additional investment.
## Hydro Turbine
Hydro turbines are devices used in hydroelectric generation plants that transfer the energy from moving water to a rotating shaft to generate electricity. These turbines rotate or spin as a response to water being introduced to their blades. These turbines are essential in the area of hydropower - the process of generating power from water.

Generally, the construction of turbines is the same. A row of blades is fitted to some rotating shaft or plate. Water is then passed through the turbine over the blades, causing the inner shaft to rotate. This rotational motion is then transferred to a generator where electricity is generated. There are a variety of different types of turbines that are best used in different situations. Each type of turbine is created to provide maximum output for the situation it is used in.

The type of turbine selected for any given hydropower project is based on the height of the water storage - known as the hydraulic head - and the volume of water that flows known as the hydroelectric discharge. Efficiency and cost are also factors to be considered.
### Turbine Flow
Hydro turbines can be classified based on how water flows through the turbine itself. When passed through a turbine, water can take a variety of different paths. This leads to three categories of water flow through turbines:

* Axial Flow: Water flows through the turbine parallel to the axis of rotation.
* Radial Flow: Water flows through the turbine perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
* Mixed Flow: Water flows through in a combination of both radial and axial flows.

For example, in a Francis turbine water flows in radially but exits axially.
Most hydro turbines tend to have mixed flows.
