# Chapter - 1
### Introduction To Technology
Technology, the application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life or, as it is sometimes phrased, to the change and manipulation of the human environment.

Technology is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e. g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.

### Appropriate Technology
Appropriate technology is a movement (and its manifestations) encompassing technological choice and application that is small-scale, decentralized, labor-intensive, energy-efficient, environmentally sound, and locally autonomous.

It was originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist Dr. Ernst Friedrich "Fritz" Schumacher in his work Small is Beautiful. Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasize the technology as people-centered.

Appropriate technology (AT) is technology that is designed to be "appropriate" to the context of its use. The most appropriate technologies are:

* **Sustainable** - requiring fewer natural resources and producing less pollution than techniques from mainstream technology, which are often wasteful and environmentally polluting.  In addition, or in envisioning a future phase of AT that lies on a more subjectively-observed axis of knowing, proponents could also claim their methods make more life(-energy) sense, are more at balance or in harmony with the natural environment, and enable appropriate, healthier, happier, more fulfilling, meaningful or purposeful ways of life.

* **Small** where possible (as in Small is Beautiful). This places more power at the grassroots, in the hands of the users. However, there are also times when the most appropriate technologies are large-scale.

* **Appropriate** to the context, including the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economical context. The appropriate technology for one context may not be appropriate for another.

To be effective in practice, an appropriate technology should be easy to maintain. To be effective for many people and have a wide impact, an appropriate technology must be affordable.

The term is usually used to describe simple technologies which are suitable for use:

* In developing nations or less developed rural areas of industrialized nations,
* In an off-the-grid setting,
* Wherever individuals or small communities wish to lower their environmental impact and increase their resilience.

This form of "appropriate technology" usually prefers labor-intensive solutions over capital-intensive ones, although labor-saving devices are also valuable, provided this does not mean high capital, maintenance cost or environmental impact.

Where the target is the poor, the greatest impact comes where massive scale-up occurs through an appealing, cost-effective product. The "bottom of the pyramid" can pay for technology if the price is right, and this allows for much greater scale than subsidized programs, and is likely to be more appealing than DIY approaches that require a particular skill-set.

Appropriate technology can be described as the simplest level of technology that can effectively achieve the intended purpose in a given location. In developed countries, the term appropriate technology takes a different meaning, often referring to engineering that takes special consideration of its social and environmental ramifications.

### Principle of Appropriate Technology
What makes "appropriate technology" is determined by context. Therefore, none of these are absolute - they are simply common features that make a technology "appropriate" to a world where many suffer a lack of basic necessities, a lack of money, and lack of equipment and technological expertise. They are also technologies that have a gentle impact on the earth:

* Small, as in Small is Beautiful. Small often means affordable and adaptable, and puts the control in the hands of the users. Small also means local, which offers benefits in resilience.
* Few moving parts - less to go wrong (similar to the KISS principle, & the Durable, efficient, sto√Øc-principle ).
* Can be built locally
* Made with locally available materials
* Easily repaired, by local people with locally available equipment.
* Affordable
* Suitably disposable - locally and not polluting in it's disposal or recycling

The source of the technology doesn't matter much - it matters much more that it is appropriate. While the source of a technology sometimes becomes an issue in discussions of technology for international development, technology from anywhere can have uptake and make an impact, as evidenced by the mobile phone.

## Use Cases

* Appropriate technologies are not necessarily "low" technology, and can utilize recent research, for example cloth filters which were inspired by research into the way cholera is carried in water. 

* High technology is used in appropriate technology applications in the form of high-efficiency white LED lights, used for example by the Light Up the World Foundation in remote areas of Nepal to replace kerosene lamps or wood fires - this reduces smoke and by doing that reduces problems with respiratory health and eyes, and can be expected to reduce child mortality.

#### Building Construction

Building methods regarded as appropriate technology include:

* Adobe and Super Adobe
* Rammed earth
* Compressed earth block
* Dutch brick
* Animal products
* Cob
* Autonomous building
* Earthship

The local context must be considered as, for example, mudbrick may not be durable in a high rainfall area, and, if the materials are not readily available, the method may be inappropriate. Other forms of natural building may be considered appropriate technology, though in many cases the emphasis is on sustainable architecture and self-sufficiency rather than affordability or suitability. As such, many buildings are also built to function as autonomous buildings (e.g. earthships, ...). One example of an organisation that applies appropriate earthbuilding techniques would be Builders Without Borders.

Where building height is important - e.g. to allow sustainable levels of density and efficient transport within a city - then traditional and alternative methods such as earthen buildings are not appropriate.

The building structure must also be considered. Cost-effectiveness is an important issue in projects based around appropriate technology, and one of the most efficient designs herein is the public housing approach. This approach lets everyone have their own sleeping/recreation space, yet incorporate communal spaces e.g. mess halls, latrines, public showers, ...

In addition, to decrease costs of operation (heating, cooling, ...) techniques as earth sheltering or Trombe walls may be incorporated.

Organizations as Architecture for Humanity also consider principles of appropriate technology, aiming to serve the needs of poor and disaster-affected people.

### Energy

Microgeneration is appropriate to remote and mobile applications, with low power requirements.

 "Appropriate" energy technologies are especially suitable for isolated and/or small scale energy needs. However, high capital cost must be taken into account.

Electricity can be provided from:

* PV solar panels (which are expensive initially, but simple), and (large) Concentrating solar power plants. PV solar panels made from low-cost photovoltaic cellsW or PV-cells which have first been concentrated by a luminescent solar concentrator-panel are also a good option.
* Wind power (home do-it yourself turbines and larger-scale)
* micro hydro, and pico hydro
* human-powered handwheel generators
* Plant microbial fuel cells
* other zero emission generation methods


Some intermediate technologies (causing still some degree of air pollution -yet no CO2-emissions-) include:

* bioalcohols as bioethanol, biomethanol and biobutanol. 
* plant oils (which can be used only in internal combustion (Diesel) engines. Biofuels are locally available in many developing countries and can be cheaper than fossil fuels.
* Anaerobic digestion power plants
* Biogas is another potential source of energy, particularly where there is an abundant supply of waste organic matter.
* Feces (eg cow dung, human, etc) can also be used.
* Biochar is another similar energy source which can be obtained through charring of certain types of organic material (eg hazelnut shells, bamboo, chicken manure, ...) in a pyrolysis unit.
* Finally, urine can also be used as a basis to generate hydrogen (which is an energy carrier). Using urine, hydrogen production is 332% more energy efficient than using water.

### Water supply and treatment

Appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use (POU) designs.

* The most reliable way to kill microbial pathogenic agents is to heat water to a rolling boil.

* Other techniques, such as varying forms of filtration, chemical disinfection, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation (including solar UV) have been demonstrated in an array of randomized control trials to significantly reduce levels of waterborne disease among users in low-income countries.




Whether applied at the household or community level, some examples of specific treatment processes include:

* Porous ceramic filtration, using either clay or diatomaceous earth, and oriented as either cylinder, pot, or disk, with gravity-fed or siphon-driven delivery systems. Silver is frequently added to provide antimicrobial enhancement
* BioSand Filtration an inexpensive water filtration appliance designed for household use in developing countries. Uses sand, gravel, and natural biological processes to remove pathogens from water.
* Intermittently operated slow-sand filtration.
* Chlorine disinfection, employing calcium hypochlorite powder, sodium hypochlorite solution, or sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) tablets
* Chemical flocculationW, using either commercially produced iron or aluminum salts or the crushed seeds of certain plants, such as Moringa oleifera
* Mixed flocculation/disinfection using commercially produced powdered mixtures
* Irradiation with ultraviolet light, whether using electric-powered lamps or direct solar exposure
membrane filtration, employing ultrafiltrationW or reverse osmosis filter elements preceded by pretreatment

Some appropriate technology water supply measures include:

* Wood Mold for Concrete BioSand Filter Production
* Deep wells with submersible pumpsW in areas where the groundwater (aquifers) are located at depths >10 m.
* Shallow wellsW with lined walls and covers.
* rainwater harvesting systems with an appropriate method of storage, especially in areas with significant dry seasons.
* Fog collection, which is suitable for areas which experience fog even when there is little rain.
* Air well, a structure or device designed to promote the condensation of atmospheric moisture.
* Handpumps and treadle pumps are generally only an option in areas is located at a relatively shallow depth (e.g. 10 m).
* Condensation bagsW and condensation pits can be an appropriate technology to get water, yet yields are low and are (for the amount of water obtained), labour intensive. Still, it may be a good (very cheap) solution for certain desperate communities.
* The hippo water roller and Q-drum allow more water to be carried, with less effort and could thus be a good alternative for ethnic communities who do not wish to give up water gathering from remote locations, assuming low topographic relief.
* The roundabout playpump, developed and used in southern Africa, harnesses the energy of children at play to pump water.
### Transportation

* Human powered-vehicle include the bicycle, which provides general-purpose, human-powered transport at a lower cost of ownership than motorized vehicles, with many gains over simply walking, and the whirlwind wheelchairW, which provides mobility for disabled people who cannot afford the expensive wheelchairs used in developed countries. 
* Animal powered vehicles/transportW may also be another appropriate technology.
* Certain zero-emissions vehicles may be considered appropriate transportation technology, including compressed air cars, liquid nitrogen and hydrogen-powered vehicles. 
* Also, vehicles with internal combustion engines may be converted to hydrogen or oxyhydrogen combustion.
* Bicycles can also be applied to commercial transport of goods to and from remote areas. An example of this is Karaba, a free-trade coffee co-op in Rwanda, which uses 400 modified bicycles to carry hundreds of pounds of coffee beans for processing.
* Other projects for developing countries include the redesign of cycle rickshaws to convert them to electric power.
### Sanitation
Ecological sanitation can be viewed as a three-step process dealing with human excreta: 
Containment,Sanitization,Recycling.

* The objective is to protect human health and the environment while limiting the use of water in sanitation systems for hand (and anal) washing only and recycling nutrients to help reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers in agriculture.

Small scale systems include:

* Composting toilets are the most environmental form of excrement disposal systems. In addition, the toilets design allows the nutrients to be reused (e.g. for fertilising food crops). Also, DIY composting toilets can be build at a very low cost.
* BiPu is a portable system suitable for disaster management, while other forms of latrine provide safe means of disposing of human waste at a low cost. 
* The Orangi Pilot Project was designed based on an urban slum's sanitation crisis. Kamal Kar has documented the latrines developed by Bangladeshi villagers once they became aware of the health problems with open defecation.
* Treatment ponds and constructed wetlands can help to purify sewage and greywater. They consist mostly of plants and therefore require only little power, and are hugely self-sufficient.
* Certain other options as Slow sand filters, UV filters, ... may also be employed.
### Lighting
* White LED and a source of renewable energy (such as solar cells) are used by the Light Up the World Foundation to provide lighting to poor people in remote areas, and provide significant benefits compared to the kerosene lamps which they replace. 
* Organic LEDs made by roll-to-roll production are another source of cheap light.
* Compact fluorescent lamps (as well as regular fluorescent lights and LED-lightbulbs) can also be used as appropriate technology. Although they are less environmentally friendly then LED-lights, they are cheaper and more efficient than incandescent lights.
* The Safe bottle lamp is a safer kerosene lamp designed in Sri Lanka. Lamps as these allow relative long, mobile, lighting. The safety comes from a secure screw-on metal lid, and two flat sides which prevent it from rolling if knocked over. 
* An alternative to fuel or oil-based lanterns is the Uday lantern, developed by Philips as part of its Lighting Africa project.
### Cooking
* Solar cookers are appropriate to some settings, depending on climate and cooking style. They are emission-less and very low-cost.
* Hot plates are 100% electrical, fairly low cost (around 20‚Ç¨) and are mobile. They do however require an electrical system to be present in the area of operation.
* Rocket stoves and certain other wood stoves  improve fuel efficiency, and reduce harmful indoor air pollution.
### Refrigeration
* Solar, special Einstein refrigerators and thermal mass refrigerators reduce the amount of electricity required. Also, solar and special Einstein refrigerators do not use haloalkanes (which play a key role in ozone depletion), but use heat pumps or mirrors instead. 
* The pot-in-pot refrigerator is an African invention which keeps things cool without electricity. It provides a way to keep food and produce fresh for much longer than would otherwise be possible. This can be a great benefit to the families who use the device. For example, it is claimed that girls who had to regularly sell fresh produce in the market can now go to school instead, as there is less urgency to sell the produce before it loses freshness.
### Ventilation and air conditioning
* Natural ventilation can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by convection and escape to the outside, while cooler air is drawn in through vents at the lower level.
* Electrical powered fans (e.g. ceiling fans) allow efficient cooling, at a far lower electricity consumption as airconditioning systems.
* A solar chimney often referred to as thermal chimney improves this natural ventilationW by using convection of airW heated by passive solar energyW. To further maximize the cooling effect, the incoming air may be led through underground ductsW before it is allowed to enter the building.
* A windcatcher used for many centuries to create natural ventilation in buildings. It is not known who first invented the windcatcher, but it still can be seen in many countries today. Windcatchers come in various designs, such as the uni-directional, bi-directional, and multi-directional.

### Health care
* According to the Global Health Council, rather than the use of professionally schooled doctors, the training of villagers to remedy most maladies in towns in the developing world is most appropriate.
* A team of social and health care workers can help improve chronic care for low income families. Trained villagers are able to eliminate 80% of the health problems.
* Small (low-cost) hospitals 

Before being able to determine the cause of the disease or malady, accurate diagnosis is required. This may be done manually (through observation, inquiries) and by specialised tools.
* Herbalist medicines (e.g. tinctures, tisanes, decoctions, ...) are appropriate medicines, as they can be freely made at home and are almost as effective as their chemical counterparts.
* A phase-change incubatorW, developed in the late 1990s, is a low cost way for health workers to incubate microbial samples.
* Birth control is also seen as an appropriate technology, especially now, because of increasing population numbers (overpopulating certain areas), increasing food prices and poverty. 
* Jaipur leg was developed by Dr. P. K. Sethi and Masterji Ram Chander in 1968 as an inexpensive prosthetic leg for victims of landmine explosions.
* The Leveraged Freedom Chair is a low-cost wheelchair designed specifically for rough terrain
* Natural cleaning productsW can be used for personal hygiene and cleaning of clothing and eating utensils; in order to decrease illnesses/maladies (as they eliminate a great amount of pathogens).

Comprehensive Rural Health Project and the Women Health Volunteers projects in countries as Iran, Iraq and Nepal.

### Information and Communication Technologies for Development
 

* The OLPC XOW, SimputerW, Eee PCW, Classmate PC, Studybook, PIC, Zonbu, Linutop, small form factor PC's and other low cost computers are computers aimed for use in developing countries. Besides the low price, other characteristics include resistance to dust, reliability and use of the target language.
* Offline knowledge sharing projects to give access to development information in areas without reliable and affordable internet access.
* The Wind-up radio and the computer and communication system planned by the Jhai Foundation are independent from power supply.
* Mobile telephony is appropriate technology for many developing countries, as it greatly reduces the infrastructure required to achieve widespread coverage. However, mobile phone network may not always be available (it depends on the location) and may not always provide both voice and data services.
* An increasing number of activists provide free or very inexpensive web and email services using cooperative computer networks that run wireless ad hoc networks.
* Network service is provided by a cooperative of neighbors, each operating a router as a household appliance. 
* Rural electrical grids can be wired with "optical phase cable", in which one or more of the steel armor wires are replaced with steel tubes containing fiber optics.
* Satellite Internet access can provide high speed connectivity to remote locations, however these are significantly more expensive than wire-based or terrestrial wireless systems. 
### Banking and finance
* Microfinance
* Small Women Saving Groups
* Agricultural Co-operative
# Technology Transfer 

Technology transfer, also called transfer of technology (TOT), is the process of transferring (disseminating) technology from the places and ingroups of its origination to wider distribution among more people and places. It occurs along various axes: among universities, from universities to businesses, from large businesses to smaller ones, from governments to businesses, across borders, both formally and informally, and both openly and surreptitiously. Often it occurs by concerted effort to share skills, knowledge, technologies, methods of manufacturing, samples of manufacturing, and facilities among governments or universities and other institutions to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can then further develop and exploit the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials, or services. It is closely related to (and may arguably be considered a subset of) knowledge transfer. Horizontal transfer is the movement of technologies from one area to another. At present[when?] transfer of technology (TOT) is primarily horizontal. Vertical transfer occurs when technologies are moved from applied research centers to research and development departments.

Contrary to popular belief, publishing your research will not guarantee that someone will notice your discovery and continue developing it into a tangible product that will reach the end user. 

### How Does Technology Transfer Occur?
* Technology is typically transferred through a license agreement in which the university retains ownership of the intellectual property, while the industrial partner obtains conditional rights to use and develop a technology. 
* Before the technology transfer can take place, inventors must define and disclose the nature of their invention to the institution‚Äôs technology transfer office. New inventions are evaluated by technology licensing experts, who determine the intellectual property position and potential market for the technology.
* The technology transfer office will not be able to proceed with the invention if there is no intellectual property available, no value to industry or appropriate competitiveness in the market. On the other hand, inventions with an appropriate intellectual property and market position are given the green light and intellectual property rights are pursued.
* An invention management and commercialization strategy can begin once the intellectual property rights are established.

Technology transfer requires a proactive approach that combines engaging researchers, promoting the technology, and encouraging potential industrial partners to use the technology.

The end goal of the commercialization strategy is to establish a commercial relationship with another party (e.g., employment, a sale or license), and negotiating a contract (e.g., compensation). A license is a contract between a licensor (e.g., the holder of a patent) and a licensee (e.g., an industry partner) that includes a number of conditions that the third party must satisfy. The licensee may be an established company or a new business start-up (that may be founded by the researcher).
### Why is Technology Transfer important?
* Technology transfer helps develop early stage intellectual property into tools for direct use by the research community, or into bases for new platforms, products, or services to be made into products for public use. 
* Successful collaborations are formed between researchers across different universities or industries in order to advance the knowledge in a particular field or to further develop a technology. 
* These collaborations may result in licensing or sponsored research opportunities that benefit both partners. 
* In addition, technology transfer ensures that the interests and rights of the university in the intellectual property are protected.
* The university is able to retain the intellectual property rights of the technology and issue a license for the conditional use of the technology.

Successful transfer and development of the technology helps promote the research institution and its commercial partners. 
## Impact of Technology in Society
The technological growth taking place in the world today is doing so very rapidly and there are new advancements being made with each passing day and this is possible owing to the large number of extensive programmes of technological research currently being done by  a large number of researchers working within non-profit research organizations, business and universities. The developments being made today are very strong and are very pervasive forces in the business environment today. Technology can easily be referred to as the scientific knowledge to the practical problems we are experiencing in the world today. There is no denying that the impact of technology in the world today is huge and can be categorized Into how it effects our society today and how it influences the business activities and operations.

### Impact of technology on society:
Technology has without doubt an impact on society. As a matter of fact, we experience this effect in our daily lives. It has an effect on the growth of the economy, our culture and our living standards. It is however important to note that the benefits are a double-edged sword with some being detrimental and other being beneficial. One should be very careful and get to know how the effects on society get to effect the business activities and operations.

### Positive Impacts Of Technology On Society
* **Technology Has Mechanized Agriculture:**
  * Modern agricultural technology allows a small number of people to grow vast quantities of food in a short period of time with less input which results into high yields and RIO ‚Äùreturn on investment‚Äù.
  * The use of technology in agriculture has also resulted in the manufacturing of genetic crops which can grow fast and they can be resistant to many pests and diseases. 
  * Also, farmers have access to artificial fertilizers which add value to the soil and boost the growth of their crops and enable them to produce high-quality yields. 
  * Farmers in dry areas have been in a position to grow healthy crops, they use advanced water pumps and sprinklers which derive water from rivers to the farms, the all process can be automated to save time. 
  * A good example is Egypt, this is a desert country which receives little rain, but small and big farmers have used automated sprinklers to irrigate their farms. In Egypt, they grow a lot of rice, yet this crop needs sufficient water to grow well. The water is pumped from River Nile to the rice fields on a daily basis.
* **Technology Has Improved Transportation:**
Transportation uses vehicles, trains, airplanes, motorbikes, people, roads, energy, information, materials, finance and time.  Technology has helped in advancing all the four types of transportation and these include ; 
(1) road transport used by automobiles ,
(2) air transport which is used by airplanes ,
(3)water transportation which is used by ships and speed boats and 
(4) space transportation used to go to the moon. 

* **Technology Has Improved Communication:**
  * Electronic media like radios, televisions, internet, social media have improved the way we exchange ideas which can develop our societies. 
  * In many countries, radios and televisions are used to voice the concerns of the society, they organize live forums where the community can contribute through mobile phones or text service systems like tweeter.
* **Technology Has Improved Education And Learning Process:**
  * Many schools have started integrating educational technologies in their schools with a great aim of improving the way students learn. 
  * Technologies like smart whiteboards, computers, mobile phones, iPads, projectors, and internet are being used in classrooms to boost students moral to learn.
  * Visual education is becoming more popular and it has proved to be the best method of learning in many subjects like mathematics, physics, biology, geography, economics and much more. 
  * Also, programs like Long distance learning have opened boundaries too so many scholars around the world.
 ### Negatives Impact on Society
* **Resource Depletion:**
  * The more demand for new technologies and advancement of current technologies, the more pressure we put on earth‚Äôs natural resources.
  * To sustain this demand, they have to exploit Mother Nature for resources like aluminum, once these resources are extracted from the earth plates, they will never return back because it took them a billion years to mature.  
  * That means that at one time, we shall be left with no natural resource which can be a problem to the future generation and economy. 
  * Likewise, the intensive farming practices will deplete the soil. This makes heavy applications of commercial fertilizers necessary to yield healthy harvests, but also these fertilizers have chemicals which are dangerous to the soil and human lives.

* **Increased Population:**
   * Technology has helped us live longer by improving health facilities and aiding in the research for solutions for most health problems which affect humans. 
   * In developed countries population growth is controlled by advanced birth control methods, this has helped them balance their population in relation to natural resources and other opportunities which come with a planned population. 
   * This is different in developing countries, the rate at which people produce is very high, the mortality rate is high, food is scarce and health care is poor.

* **Increased Pollution:**
* The increased demand for new technologies and advancement of technologies has resulted in many manufacturing and processing factories. 
* They release harmful chemicals and gasses which have polluted our environment and this has resulted in climate changes (global warming).
* So the more technology we enjoy, the more we harm our environment. 
* Experts have tried to implement ways of reducing this impact by encouraging factories to go green, to a small extent, this has been achieved through the development of green technologies like; green cars, green computers, but a great effort is still needed to reduce the pollution of the air and the earth.
